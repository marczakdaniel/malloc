# malloc

Basic implementation of C library function - malloc. I used LIFO, boundary tags, best-fit strategies and optimized realloc. 

The project was carried out during Operation System classes. 

The code written by me is in the file mm.c. The rest is code provided by the lecturers to test the correctness of the solution.
